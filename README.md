One of a few practice apps I made when I first started my iOS Development learning journey

This was my very first iOS app that I created when I was practicing tutorials and work from Stanford Universities CS193P iOS 9 Development course. I found this app along with one other hidden away in an old rusted flash drive. This was before I learned how to use git back in 2014 so I figured I'd upload it for memories sake and possibly to finish/update the app in the future. The app is currently functional after all these years however it didn't age well with the iOS sdk changes.

Below are some screenshots of some of the things in the app:
